# A collection of small neat vim tidbits

## What is this?
Vim editors are filled to the brim with features, even ignoring the whole
plugin ecosystem. It's near impossible to know everything about it, and even
after more than a decade working in vim I find some hidden gems.

This is a collection of things that made me go "wait, you can do that?", or in
some cases features I've known about for so long that triggered that response
in others. In short, neat features that people are likely to miss unless they
accidentally stumble into them.

The articles are short and mainly serves to showcase a few select features, and
included asciinema recordings to show them off where reasonable.

## What even is this setup?
This is a very hackily put together thing, just the most bare bones thing to
allow me to put a few posts up on my server. On the positive side, it's small
and hackable to do what I need it to.

Tools you need to make this thing work are `pandoc`, `bash` and some utils
that more than likely makes the assumption that you're running them on linux.

The thing lives at https://algmyr.se/vim/ but I make no uptime guarantees. :)
